The practice of mutual aid has been a deep part of human society and social relationships for ages. As social beings, humans naturally come together to form networks of care and reciprocity that sustain us through times of crises.

Mutual aid isn't charity though &mdash; it's a recognition that each and everyone of us participate in the shaping of our world and relationships.

Mutual aid is a rejection of the idea that _some of us_ survive at the cost of others, and an embrace of our own interconnectivity.
