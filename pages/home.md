    Politicians, governments, and a system designed to extract the most out of us for the least in return have lead us into disaster on a global scale. It's up to us to take care of one another and build the networks of support with our neighbors that will help us survive future disasters.

# Free fresh meals and more in the Wilmore and Downtown area of Long Beach

We cook, share food with, and deliver groceries or run errands for our neighbors in need **for free, as we are able to.**

We practice **mutual aid** in order to support one another and keep everyone safe and healthy as we weather the COVID-19 pandemic together, even if we are physically apart.
