## Local development

### 1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/.laura-is-here/truckee-meadows-jbgc.git your-directory
```

### 2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd your-directory
```

Specifically have a look at `.eleventy.js` to see if you want to configure any Eleventy options differently.

### 3. Install dependencies locally

```
npm install
```

### 4. Edit \_data/metadata.json

This file contains your site title and author details, and can be used to store any other commonly used site data.

### 5. Run Eleventy (builds the site)

```
npm run build
```

Or build automatically when a template changes:

```
npm run dev
```
